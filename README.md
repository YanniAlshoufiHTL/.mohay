# .mohay

###### An online programming language made as a project for school.

## Participants

This Project is being fully developed—Frontend and Backend—by Yane Al Shoufi, Moriz Bernhofer and Luca Haas.

## Idea

.mohay is a programming language that can be used online to draw, animate and make the user interactable with shapes. It can be used as an easy-to-use JS-Canvas replacement for trying things out, having fun and practicing programming or coding.

Due to the first semester being only about HTML and (S)CSS, we'll start working on a static documentation page for the language.

In the second semester we will be working on an online .mohay Compiler on our Website. We will also be working together with another team to create an Scratch coding space on the other teams website.

## Motivation

All three of us are enthusiastic programmers that love challenges. Thus, we took the challenge to make a compiler-like tool, which is more on the hard side do realize.
