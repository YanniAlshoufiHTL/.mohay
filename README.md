# .mohay

###### An online programming language made as a project for school.

## Participants

This Project is being fully developed—Frontend and Backend—by Yane Al Shoufi, Moriz Bernhofer and Luca Haas.

## Idea

.mohay is a programming language that can be used online to draw, animate and make the user interactable with shapes. It can be used as an easy-to-use JS-Canvas replacement for trying things out, having fun and practicing programming or coding.

Due to the first semester being only about HTML and (S)CSS, we'll start working on a static documentation page for the language.

## Motivation

All three of us are enthusiastic programmers that love challenges. Thus, we took the challenge to make a compiler-like tool, which is more on the hard side do realize.

## Technologies

### Frontend

HTML, SCSS

### Backend

Presumably: JS/TS, NodeJS, some relational database
